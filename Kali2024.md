## Introduction
Last Update: Sept. 2024

The purpose of this page is to share my notes on setting up kali VM after installation from Kali 2024.2 ISO, updated for 2024.3.

#### Enable and Start OpenSSH Server
```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```


#### Setup SSH known keys for the host to authenticate
```bash
ssh-keygen
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Additional packages that do not come pre-installed:

```bash
sudo apt install openssl jupyter-notebook remmina mingw-w64 golang software-properties-common apt-transport-https obsidian
```

#### Install Visual Studio Code
Reference: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

```bash
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg

sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg

echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" |sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list > /dev/null

rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg

sudo apt update

sudo apt install code
```

#### Add non-privileged user
I may use this non-privileged user in the event I need to browse the internet for a random item...

Verify the User ID of 1001 is available
```bash
sudo useradd -m -d /home/thebabyn3rd -u 1001 -s /bin/bash thebabyn3rd

# Set password for the user account created
passwd thebabyn3rd
```


#### Git Clone SecLists
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists is a great repository to pull down lists that can be used in penetration testing and blue team testing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```
