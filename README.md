# Adventures of Learning Go

This collection of golang programs is for educational use only.  As I read the book "Blackhat Go", expanded those projects described and explored my own desires this repository started to take shape.  This is my attempt to document the projects for others to use, to decrease relearning some of the topics and share with the community.

[Compiling Go Notes](Compiling_Notes.md) - How to install, compile for Linux, Windows, a Windows DLL and a Windows Binary for Shellcode

[Setup git and obsidian](gitAndObsidian.md) Configure git and obsidian to work with these projects

[Configuration Notes for Kali 2024.2](Kali2024.md) Configuration notes for a fresh install of Kali Linux from ISO

# Operations

[Operation "Build the House"](/redteam/README.md) - Notes on using a combination of the below projects for a red team engagement.

[Operation "Leia o Livro"](/BHGO/README.md) - Projects created as I read the book, "Blackhat Go".  These projects I have extended and added to them as I learned golang.

[Operation "Morph Injector"](/projects/memoryInjection/main.go) - The project is a clone of go-shellcode however modifying it to have 1 binary that can test the 14 methods of injections available.  Currently of the 14, 13 are working.  

[Operation "Sticky"](/projects/honeypots/README.md) - The project is a variety of honeypots built to lure connections to a logon page, then observe the pages explored, POST requests sent and what is creating the traffic.
# Projects

[AMSI Bypass](/projects/amsiBypass/README.md) - Python script that generates a dynamic amsi bypass.  The output contains 2 sections, 1 for copy paste execution, the other creates an a.ps1 file for execution

[Binary Exploitation](/projects/binaryExploitation/README.md) - Impressed by how 7Rocky solved regularity on HTB, I learned from his pwntools and HTB script for regularity.  I love how in pwntools it treats the cmd.stdin or cmd.stdout in a similar way to network input or network output.  This greatly simplifies creating code to solve the HTB challenge when they give you a binary and then you need to connect to a network connection to gather the flag.  

[Calculate Entropy of a File](/projects/calcEntropy/main.go) - Simple prog to calculate the overall entropy of a file then it breaks down the file into 256 byte chunks and shows the chunks that have a higher entropy than the parent.  For example, if a golang prog has a long string created from the base64 of a series of characters, it may be detected as being abnormal and the chunk will be displayed due to higher entropy than the overall file.

[Compiled Javascript V8](/projects/compileJavascriptV8/README.md) - Worked with a go library called v8go to generate compiled JSC files.  Attempted to use them to serve an HTML webpage with the javascript.  Also, documented how to create compiled files for Windows, Mac and Linux using NodeJS.  They are stand-alone executables.  The code can interact with the Windows API.  Threat actors are utilizing compiled javascript to hide execution because very few tools exist to view or decompile them. (View8 is a tool that can be used to decompile JSC files)  

[ConnectWise Honeypot](/projects/honeypots/connectwiseHoneypot) - Simple honeypot emulating a logon page of a ConnectWise server

[Create Certs](/projects/createCerts/README.md) - Project to create a server.crt and server.key file using a configuration file.

[CVE-2024-38112](/projects/cve-2024-38112/main.go) - Project to emulate Void Banshee exploit chain, learned about protocol handlers in the registry, ran a .url file, to then launch a .hta file which opened a powershell script on the webserver.  Created the golang prog to be self containing.

[C2 Server, Client and Operator](/projects/c2/README.md) - Emulation of the Sysjoker C2

[EVTX Parser](/projects/evtxParser/main.go) - EVTX Parser

[Fake Data Generator](/projects/fakeDataGenerator/README.md) - Project that creates fake data to test the controls of data leak prevention

[Fortinet Honeypot](/projects/honeypots/fortinetHoneypot/README.md) - A simple honeypot to emulate the logon page of Fortigate or FortiProxy

[HTTP2 Scanner](/projects/http2Scanner/main.go) - This identifies if a connection can be made to a server using the HTTP/2 protocol.

[HTML Smuggling](/projects/htmlSmuggling/README.md) - Project that creates an index.html file and an accompanying my.js file to place on a website.  The my.js file contains a specified ISO file or file of choice to be automatically downloaded in the browser.

[IP to Decimal Calculator](/projects/ipToDecimal/main.go) - Created this project due to a limitation of a tool being able to calculate if an IP Address is between 2 other IP Addresses.  This allowed for the math to test if the decimal representation of an IP was between 2 others.

[ISO Creator](/projects/isoCreator/README.md) - Project to create ISO files on linux or windows

[Ivanti Honeypot](/projects/honeypots/ivantiHoneypot/README.md) - A simple honeypot that I created to emulate an Ivanti Pulse Secure VPN to capture payloads that are being used

[LNK Creator](/projects/lnkCreator/README.md) - Project to evaluate and create LNK files.  WARNING: This project is incomplete, however does have great references, how to build LNK files with powershell and then how to copy those LNK files to windows.

[Memory Injection Techniques Test](/projects/memoryInjection/main.go) - The project is a clone of go-shellcode however modifying it to have 1 binary that can test the 13 methods of injections available.  Currently the UUID String Method is not working. (Copied as a txt file the ShellCodeUtils that was built)

[MSBuild XML - T1127.001](/projects/msBuildXML/README.md) - Built a golang prog that will create an XML file to be used with the technique to compile code on a host and then execute it.  Uses a config.json file that takes parameters for the configuration, uses an SSH connection to execute and create the payload (or a custom payload), and then creates the XML file or .csproj file.  

[Password Generator](/projects/passwordGenerator/README.md) - Simple password generator.  Takes a pattern and then can output a randomly generated password

[Sliver Payload Generator](/project/sliverPayloadGenerator/README.md) - This creates commands that build in sliver a staged payload with AES encryption, a profile, the session payload and a powershell script that can be used to execute on the host

[SQL Injection with Simple Web Request](/projects/injectionWebRequest/main.go) - This is a prog that is adapted from a simple web request adapted to allow SQL injection where "xxx" is placed in the data of a POST variable.  Then you can truncate the output with cutabove and cutbelow settings.

[URL Shortcut Creator](/projects/urlShortcut/main.go) - A simple program to create a ".url" shortcut to test the CVE-2024-38112 vulnerability

[XOR File](/projects/xorFile/main.go) - This simple program will xor a file and encrypt or decrypt it with a provided key file

[Yet Another Phishing Proxy](/projects/yaPhishingProxy/README.md) - This proxy receives as input the URL it is listening for and then the URL that it is connecting to.  As the HTML passes through it, the links if matching the respective URLs will be changed and logged to stdout.  The POST parameters are logged to stdout also.

[Yet Another Reverse Proxy](/projects/yaReverseProxy/main.go) - Simple Reverse Proxy

[Yet Another Web Server](/projects/yaWebServer/README.md) - The web server allows for upload of files, download, on-the-fly compiling of go programs and download, viewing of markdown files in a library, use of cyberchef, and storage of temporary notes.  Useful in CTFs and hacking challenges where moving flags or information to a host is challenging.  Also configured so a specific user can be specified on Linux and the port it can execute with.
