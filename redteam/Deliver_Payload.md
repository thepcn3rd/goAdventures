# Payload Delivery
Threat actors will establish a chain of events to be able to deliver a payload.  The following chain of events is what I created.
- [Create Sliver staged Payload](/redteam/Sliver_Payloads.md)
- [Create LNK file](/projects/lnkCreator/README.md) with arguments to execute the Sliver Payload
- Embed the LNK file, Sliver Payload and any additional files like an AMSI Bypass in a custom [created ISO](/projects/isoCreator/README.md)
- Deliver the ISO file through [HTML Smuggling](/projects/htmlSmuggling/README.md)
