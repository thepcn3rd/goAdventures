### Sliver 

The default payloads are caught by Windows Defender, with some assistance of various articles online I build in Sliver a staged payload that was not caught that could allow the installation of a beacon or a session.

Here is the [initial python](/projects/sliverPayloadGenerator/sliverPayloadGenerator.py) script that I wrote.  The python script did not have the capability to generate SSL/TLS certificates and was dependent on them being generated by Metasploit.

### Project to Create Certs

Created a project where go will [create the certs](/projects/createCerts/README.md) instead of being dependent on the Metasploit Framework.  The project reads a certConfig.json file.  The following are the options of executing this program.

```txt
Usage of ./createCerts.bin:
  -config string
    	Location of the configuration file for certificate generation (default "certConfig.json")
```

Because of using certificates in multiple projects created a commonCreateCerts.go file and used it in other projects.

### Scripted the Creation of Sliver Payloads

Under [projects/sliverPayloadGenerator](/projects/sliverPayloadGenerator/README.md) is where this project is located.  In this project it included the commonCreateCerts.go in the commonFunctions directory.
