# AMSI Bypass

This is a simple script that creates a dynamic AMSI Bypass and outputs 2 sections:

- Execution Ready AMSI Bypass - The code is ready to be executed

- Output of a a.ps1 file for Execution - The code outputs powershell that will create a a.ps1 file to then allow execution to create the file on disk to be executed.
