# Binary Exploitation

Impressed by how 7Rocky solved regularity on HTB, I learned from his pwntools and HTB script for regularity.  I love how in pwntools it treats the cmd.stdin or cmd.stdout in a similar way to network input or network output.  This greatly simplifies creating code to solve the HTB challenge when they give you a binary and then you need to connect to a network connection to gather the flag.  


## HTB Challenges

[Regularity](/projects/binaryExploitation/Regularity_HTB/main.go) - Used 7Rocky pwntools to solve the challenge

[Writing on the Wall](/projects/binaryExploitation/WritingOnTheWall_HTB/main.go) - Used 7Rocky pwntools to solve the challenge

[Questionnaire](/projects/binaryExploitation/Questionnairre_HTB) - Tried using pwntools but it was easier just to generate the payload and then copy it in...


## Tools

Binary Ninja - Free version available - Less complicated than Ghidra

Ghidra - Free

checksec - Easy install on Kali 2024.3 - tool to determine the security mechanisms compiled with a binary.
```bash
checksec --file=($filename)
```
